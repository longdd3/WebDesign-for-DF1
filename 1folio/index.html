                Hi, This is Long. Iâ€™m a <em>Graphic and Web Designer</em>. This is my portfolio website, with experience
                managing global teams and creative skills I made and created fine art work such as Typography, Visual
                Design, Printing 3D, and other fields. Eager to learn new skills and advance knowledge with hands-on
                experience. Proficient in Adobe Illustrator and After Effect with advanced interpersonal abilities. I
                started working on many projects while studying in Troy University. I work really hard with digital
                drawing like Illustrator and Photoshop. I took Graphic Design for launching my skills and careers
                because I have attention to detail and a talent for creating memorable visual designs. I can come up
                with a wild and crazy idea immediately after a tepid idea, and both may be sound. Below are a few of my
                designs that I did, I hope you guys enjoy them,

                simply getting them to vote. </p>
