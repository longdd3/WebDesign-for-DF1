18 on the track got mad energy like crack
i’ve been working on my skills so i can finally get that plaque
no i’m not the best but i got skills it’s true
speak english like i’m native from the red white and blue

i got that fresh out the oven flow
like you’ve never seen before
gotta make sure that i leave them wanting more
got the influence to turn a good girl to a hoe
fuck around with me you gon wake up feeling sore

i don’t fuck around i’m here to stay no matter you say
just wait till i blow up like a film by michael bay
till then imma hustle and keep fighting for the light
cause i know i see my future and it’s too damn bright

i got the hard bars
spittin for hours
fly to outer space all the way to mars

i got that sick beat
you can’t compete
turn away before you melt from all this heat

i got that fresh out the oven flow
like you never seen before
imma make you want more

i got that young soul
you can’t control
so toxic i’m bringing back the ozone hole

i don’t fuck around i’m here to stay no matter you say
just wait till i blow up like a film by michael bay
till then imma hustle and keep fighting for the light
cause i know i see my future and it’s too damn bright
i know i’m not perfect cause we all have flaws
but imma make my wish come true like santa claus
i’ll be jumping from beat to beat till the day i die
just fighting for my name like a samurai

i got the hard bars
spittin for hours
fly to outer space all the way to mars

i got that sick beat
you can’t compete
turn away before you melt from all this heat

i got that fresh out the oven flow
like you never seen before
imma make you want more

i got that young soul
you can’t control
so toxic i’m bringing back the ozone hole
